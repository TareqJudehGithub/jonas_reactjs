props
 - A way to communicate (pass data) between parent and child components.
 - props are external data, data coming from the parent component.
 - props can be updated only by the parent component.
 - props are essential to configure and to customize components.
 
 - With props, parent components "control" how child components should look like
   and how they should work.
 - We can pass any type of value as a prop.
 - props are immutable (read-only). In case we needed to mutate a prop, then we need a state.

- How props works in React?
 - first we pass a propName in the parent component under App component.
 - In the child, component function header, include a param (usually props).
 - Inside the child component function body, in the {JSX code} pass the props you need.

 - Receiving new props causes component to re-render. Usually when the parent's state
   has been updated.
 - Props are used by parents to configure child components (settings).
