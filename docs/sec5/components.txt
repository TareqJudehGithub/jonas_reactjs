Components
 - Reusable functions for React.
 - Components must be PascalCase, and also must return values.
 - Each component can return one element.
 - /public/ folder is the root folder, is where we put resources like images, and other 
   related files.   Like wwwrooot folder in MVC Core.
 - A component should NEVER mutate/update data coming from outside (see props and state 
   below for more info).
 - In React, data flow* is one-way. Data can only be passed from parent to child 
   components, but NEVER the opposite way.

 What is JSX?
   - A declarative syntax to describe what Components look like and how they work.
   - Declarative VS Imperative.
   - JSX is what we return from each component.
    - In the im approach, we tell the app exactly what to do, like when using JS, we 
      have to manually manipulate the dOM.
    - In Declarative approach, we describe what the UI should look like based on data 
      provided in the component.
    - React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM.




One-way data flow benefits
  - Makes applications more predictable and easier to understand.
  - Makes applications easier to debug, as we have more control over the data.
  - One-way data flow is more performant.
