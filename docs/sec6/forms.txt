Forms in React

e.preventDefault() prevents SPA from reloading the whole page.

Controlled Elements
 - With Controlled Elements, React controls the state of input fields, and not 
   the DOM.
 - Controlled Elements enables react to always keep the state up to date with the
   form elements. 

 - To apply the Controlled Elements technique, follow these steps below:
   1. We create a state.
    const [input, setInput] = "";
   2. Use the state we create in step .1 as a value for inputs.
    <input type="text" value={input} />
   3. Connect the state with the value we type in the input(s).
    <input 
      type="text" 
      value={input} 
      onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
      />
   4. The new state (setInput) we set it again by typing new inputs, by firing the 
      onChange event, a new state will be set every time with a new value.


  Explaining e.target.value
   e.target.value is always a string
   e          The event it self
   target     The entire input element 
   value      The the input value provided by the user.
     

  - After finishing submitting a new item, the state should always go back to its 
    initial state.
