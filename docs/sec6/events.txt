Handling events in React
 - React is declarative, so handling events in React is just passing the function head
   to the action element, without the need to use addEventListener() like the case 
   in JS.

  function handleClickButton()
  {
    return // some action (show elert, show a popup, etc..)
  }
  <button onClick={handleClickButton}>
